#
So this is my LS

##
compile:

```
make
```

##
run
```
./ft_ls <args>

## I need help with
```
./ft_ls -a
```
- Does not print in the right order
```
./ft_ls -t
```
- Something goes wrong with either the sorting or the printing of files
```
./ft_ls -tla
```
- Looks like the char **tmp list of '.''s content does not get delimited properly
